# Agent Gotham (Generative Cities)

Hackathon project (22.11.2025): 

Have you ever thought of generating a 3D model of something tiny and then printing it? Well, how about generating a flat? A building? A park? How about generating a whole city?

You define a budget, intent and architecture style for the planned project, select an area on the map - and boom! You get a video preview of the finalised project, a list of costs, all the blueprints and the construction plan for it. Just fax it to your family friends running a construction company and... done.

Disclaimer: the project was build using 3 partner technologies from the hackathon:
- OpenAI to generate code
- Lovable to sketch some frontend needed for such a complex project
- VEED / fal.ai to generate images, videos and blueprints of the final project

## Setup

1. `npm install`
2. Configure fal.ai: copy/paste your fal.ai API token into config.txt

## Run

1. `npm start`
2. Open http://localhost:3000, insert all the parameters and go.
